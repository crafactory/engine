# Verification results

Executed on 2026-10-11 on Linux x64 with Node.js 22.23.3. These results verify the listed Engine behaviors, not full Obsidian equivalence or all supported operating systems.

## Executed checks

| Check | Result | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run test` | 55 passed | YAML, references, tags, search, templates, safe Bases expressions, real vault filesystem, Unicode paths, conflicts, recovery, trash, traversal/symlink safety |
| `npm run build` | Passed | Strict TypeScript checking and Vite production bundle |
| `npm run test:e2e` | 23 passed | Real browser keyboard/mouse/input flows, editing, metadata, tasks, palette, search, graph, Canvas, Bases, bookmarks, rename, recovery, templates, theme, layout, import/export, math/diagrams, slides, narrow viewport |
| `npm run test:desktop` | 6 passed | Electron app protocol, actual disk writes, watcher, rename/link update, trash, immediate-close save, Unicode paths/content, opt-in Worker plugin |
| Same desktop suite against `release/linux-unpacked/crafactory-engine` | 6 passed | Actual packaged Electron executable and packaged resources, not the development server |
| Same desktop suite against the executable extracted from the AppImage | 6 passed | Locally built AppImage payload; not a FUSE mount or installation test |
| Linux AppImage and Debian package build | Passed | Electron-builder Linux x64 packaging; unsigned artifacts |
| `npm audit --omit=dev` | 0 known advisories reported | Installed production dependency graph at check time, not a security guarantee |
| `npm audit` | 8 moderate, 0 high, 0 critical advisories | Remaining build-tool dependency chain through electron-builder / @electron/get / global-agent / roarr / sprintf-js |

The pushed implementation commit `73c0daca21c1f5fba3ad8c91bd6974d119ba56f8` passed [the GitHub Actions Verify workflow](https://github.com/crafactory/engine/actions/runs/38155611092), including install, unit/build, browser, and desktop checks. Subsequent documentation and package-metadata commits should be checked through their own workflow runs.

The [Linux prerelease workflow](https://github.com/crafactory/engine/actions/runs/38156323024) also passed unit/build, packaging and packaged-executable desktop tests before publishing [v0.1.0](https://github.com/crafactory/engine/releases/tag/v0.1.0). The separate [three-platform packaging workflow](https://github.com/crafactory/engine/actions/runs/38156310973) successfully built Linux, Windows and macOS artifacts; Windows/macOS native runtime and installation behavior remain unverified.

## Visual inspection

Desktop reading views were inspected in dark and light mode at 1440×940, and the narrow layout was inspected at 390×844. Source/live editors, settings, graph, Canvas, and Bases screenshots are committed in `docs/images`.

No page-level horizontal overflow was found at those viewports. The inspected reading views, dialogs, settings, and table controls did not show unintended text overflow or layering defects. Graph filter controls were moved out of the graph drawing area after detecting label occlusion. Canvas cards are intentionally bounded previews; long note content is not fully visible in a card.

The manual browser session reported no uncaught page errors after corrections. Narrow-screen responsiveness is not native mobile support.

## Corrections made during QA

- A new Canvas card initially retained a stale edit callback. The callback now reads the latest canvas data, and add/edit/save/source round-trip passes.
- Reading-view template insertion previously placed frontmatter at the wrong location. Properties now merge into frontmatter and template body is appended safely for that flow.
- Live editing now keeps YAML frontmatter out of the editing surface while preserving it through saves and property updates.
- Browser ZIP export initially attempted to fetch blob attachments under a restrictive CSP. Preview attachments now use data URLs and the import/image/ZIP flow passes.
- Browser and desktop suites initially shared an output directory, causing trace cleanup collisions when run concurrently. Desktop output is now separated.
- Dependencies were updated to remove reported production advisories and the old test-tool high/critical advisories. Remaining moderate build-tool advisories are explicitly retained as open work rather than hidden by incompatible overrides.

## Not verified

- Native macOS/Windows runtime behavior, signed/notarized installers, and installation/upgrade/uninstall behavior.
- Android/iOS apps, reference plugin compatibility, first-party browser extension parity, or complete reference settings/commands.
- Full live block rendering, the full `.base` expression language, all JSON Canvas fields/interaction semantics, or every Markdown grammar edge case.
- Audio hardware recording, OS PDF save/visual fidelity, arbitrary external sites, adversarial plugin containment, and very-large vault performance.
- OS crash/power-loss durability, multi-process vault access, cross-platform filesystem permission preservation, or a complete security/accessibility audit.

The Xvfb desktop test launcher uses `--no-sandbox` solely for test-environment execution. Production configuration keeps renderer sandboxing enabled; these runs do not certify OS sandbox enforcement.

Consult `PARITY.md` for the broader unfinished target and `SECURITY.md` before testing with important data.
